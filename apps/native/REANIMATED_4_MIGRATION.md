# React Native Reanimated 4.x Migration Summary

## Migration Date
September 16, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **react-native-reanimated**: 3.17.5 â†’ 4.1.0
- **react-native-worklets**: Added ^0.5.1 (new dependency required for Reanimated 4)

### 2. New Architecture Enabled
- Added `"newArchEnabled": true` to app.json to enable React Native's New Architecture
- This is required as Reanimated 4 only supports the New Architecture

### 3. Babel Configuration
- Added `'react-native-worklets/plugin'` to babel.config.js plugins array
- Replaced the deprecated `'react-native-reanimated/plugin'` with the new worklets plugin

### 4. Files Modified
- `/apps/native/app.json` - Added newArchEnabled flag
- `/apps/native/package.json` - Updated dependencies
- `/apps/native/babel.config.js` - Added worklets plugin

## Animation Code Review
No code changes were required for existing animations. The following files use withSpring and were verified to be compatible:
- `components/forms/onboarding/BaseOnboardingForm.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/OnboardingGroupPager.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/GroupPageIndicator.tsx`
- `components/onboarding/GroupProgressBar.tsx`
- `components/ui/progress-bar.tsx`

## Testing Required
After running the app with `pnpm dev` or `pnpm ios`:
1. Test all onboarding animations
2. Verify spring animations work correctly
3. Test gesture handlers in forms
4. Check progress bar animations
5. Monitor performance on physical devices

## Rollback Instructions
If issues occur:
1. Revert package.json to use `"react-native-reanimated": "~3.17.5"`
2. Remove `"react-native-worklets"` from dependencies
3. Remove `"newArchEnabled": true` from app.json
4. Remove `'react-native-worklets/plugin'` from babel.config.js
5. Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and `pnpm install`

## Notes
- No deprecated APIs were found in the codebase
- All withSpring usages are compatible with v4
- The migration primarily involved dependency updates and enabling the New Architecture
